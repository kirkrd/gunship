# Gunship
## About
Gunship is a game engine i am using to learn more about C++. I have no prior
experience with lower level languages so this is a playground for this purpose.


## Development plan

Stage 1: Basic Engine Setup

Implement a game loop.
Add basic input handling (keyboard events).

Stage 2: Graphics

Integrate a graphics library (e.g., SDL2 or SFML).
Render basic shapes and move them around.

Stage 3: Entities and Components

Implement an entity-component system (ECS) to manage game objects.
Add basic physics (e.g., collision detection).

Stage 4: Advanced Features

Implement a scripting system (e.g., using Lua).
Add sound effects and music.
Optimize performance (e.g., using multi-threading).
